A swift introduction
------------------------

Swift Basics:
  Strongly typed
  arrays can be strongly typed as well
    array += [array, array]
  Optionals
    if let thing{
      println(thing)
    } else {
      println(nothing)
    }
  Functions
    func goodnight(name: String) -> String {
      return "Good Night \(name)"
    }
    Functions can also define their variables differently

  Playground:
    for testing code, has lots of visual helpers
